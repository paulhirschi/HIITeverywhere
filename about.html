      <span class="highlight2">High Intensity Interval Training</span>.<br>  The goal is to exercise at 90% to 100% maximum effort for a period of time, followed by a short rest. Complete 8 to 10 reps before giving yourself a longer rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The types of workouts do not change based on the skill level you choose.  What does change is the amount of time you workout before you rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these HIIT workouts are bodyweight based, meaning you don't need any weights or any other special equipment.  Just yourself and some motivation!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the workouts are pretty well known, especially if you've done HIIT training before.  If you are not familiar with a workout, give it a quick web search.

      I've loved making this app, and I hope you love using it.

      HIT IT!
