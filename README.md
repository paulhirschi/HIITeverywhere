### A fitness App for people on the go!
This app is the child of necessity.  I have about 6 fitness apps on my smart phone, but in order to just get going with a workout, I would need to select a ton of options.

I wanted something that could get me up and running with a great interval workout with a few simple clicks of a button, but with the ability to still choose from a wide range of targeted workouts for the main muscle groups.

1. Select body region you want to work out

2. Select level of intensity

3. **GET YOUR FIT ON**

This app uses a randomized selection of pre-defined workouts for each muscle group.  And because *burpees* are so lovely, no matter which workout you pick...you're gonna be doing burpees.
